If statement in python:
In java, if statement would be :

if(a/b){
  xxxx
}
else{
  aaaa
}

It's obvious that the brackets limit the content and made easy to read, but in python,

if a>b :
  print(xxxx)
else:
  print(xxxx)
  
Sometimes when reading through the lines, I will get confused like is the if statement complete ?
