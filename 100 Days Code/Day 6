        <p>To be honest, this is the first time that I get in touch with website making.</p>
        <p>This is not my <i>FIRST </i> EECS course, I have taken <b>1710</b> and <b>1720</b> before, though
        I could say that <mark>I have some foundations on Java language and logic</mark>,<br> therefore <del>I can pay less attention on this class
        </del> I will treat this course more servious in order to get a <sup>higher</sup> mark!</p>
