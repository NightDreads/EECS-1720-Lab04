Array Length:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h2>JavaScript Array Methods</h2>
<p>The length property provides an easy way to append new elements to an array without using the push() method:</p>

<p id="demo1"></p>
<p id="demo2"></p>

<script>
const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
document.getElementById("demo1").innerHTML = fruits;
fruits[fruits.length] = "Kiwi";
document.getElementById("demo2").innerHTML = fruits;
</script>

</body>
</html>

Output result is :
Banana,Orange,Apple,Mango

Banana,Orange,Apple,Mango,Kiwi

Because the length of the original array is 4, and the 4th position doesn't exist in the original array since the first array starts with "0".
Therefore there could be infinite elements been added by this method until it reach the data limits
