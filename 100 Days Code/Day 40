JavaScript delete method:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h2>JavaScript Array Methods</h2>
<p>Deleting elements leaves undefined holes in an array:</p>

<p id="demo1"></p>
<p id="demo2"></p>

<script>
const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];

document.getElementById("demo1").innerHTML =
"The first fruit is: " + fruits[0];

delete fruits[0];

document.getElementById("demo2").innerHTML =
"The first fruit is: " + fruits[0];
</script>

</body>
</html>

It's pretty strange that this delete method just like destory, which leaves an empty hole after, that means:
The first fruit is: Banana

The first fruit is: undefined

undefined, delete the element in the position completely
